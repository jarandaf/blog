## About

Hi! My name is Jordi Aranda and I was born in Olesa de Montserrat in 1989, Catalonia. Currently I am working at [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](http://www.bsc.es) as Software Engineer. Before that, I studied Computer Science at [FIB - Barcelona School of Informatics](http://www.fib.upc.edu/en.html).

It was there where I discovered functional programming and from that very moment I fell in love with it. I do currently use Scala and Haskell in my hobby projects.

I am interested in a pretty wide list of topics, from programming to machine learning and statistics. I like playing with data and getting insight out of it.

A part from that, in my spare time I do usually listen to music, hang out with friends, travel, learn (programming) languages and play chess.
