## About

Hi! My name is Jordi Aranda and I was born in Olesa de Montserrat in 1989, Catalonia. Currently I am working at [BBVA Data & Analytics](http://www.bbvadata.com/), where we build data-based products. Before that, I studied Computer Science at [FIB - Barcelona School of Informatics](http://www.fib.upc.edu/en.html).

I am interested in a pretty wide list of topics, from functional programming to data processing and visualization, with some bits of machine learning and statistics. I like playing with data and getting insight out of it.

A part from that, in my spare time I do usually listen to music, read some books, hang out with friends, travel, learn (programming) languages and play chess.
